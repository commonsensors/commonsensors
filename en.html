					<br>oh you know's
					<br>fine you's and all that mumble
					<br>that i'm bored to shreds if i can't speak in person
					<br>with my mouth buried in you
					<br>
					<br>but you don't vibe with kelela or yourself
					<br>and i've run out of the words worth wound licking

					<br>oh fuck please don't start once more with that shit's
					<br>until you hit the filter of your cigs
					<br>cough once and curl upon me
					<br>telling you to cut on fucking up your lungs
					<br>you give me *kanye shrugs*
					<br>and say i worry way too much for way too little
					<br>
					<br>and time grows legs to catch the last night train
					<br>i can't afford to catch a breath
					<br>or tell you i'm afraid that i will miss you once again
					<br>so i sink my voice in the tv
					<br>playing an artsy flick we've already seen
					<br>and only speak to say some bs i don't feel
					<br>just for you to feel something for me too
					<br>even disgust

					the sun bleeds into my birthmarks

					<br>still the hand guns chill my jaw down
					<br>and i'm gassed again
					<br>i slip from the atmosphere and drop on the ceiling
					<br>i swim through my tarpit sinking neck deep
					<br>so many years staying on the surface
					<br>it seems as swimming really grew out of me
					<br>and the wave hairpulls me
					<br>and i bust my head open bumping satellites
					<br>until the stardust pours out of me
					<br>and my thoughts get stuck in orbit
					<br>round and round the shore
					<br>round and round so devil catches up to me at last
					<br>but i ran out of my breaths halfway there somewhere
					<br>guess i never really grew a pair for night swimming
					<br>or at least to change the title here

					<br>red light on the corner and the tires screech
					<br>you take a look over your sunglasses fishing for faces

					<br>an obese man in one wrecked civic
					<br>two stoners working part time for the wendy's

					<br>another batshit day living in miami
					<br>how many can recall your name today
					<br>the telephone rings only for the rent
					<br>the tl got filled with incels
					<br>and the days now pass by on the bed
					<br>watching sunbeams reaching from the blinds
					<br>like days passing

					<br>with the thought of someone somewhere right now
					<br>would still be beating off to this at least in private

					It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. "This is something that can't be done in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do it".
